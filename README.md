# Rental Manager
A kivy app that manages rentals. This app was inspired by the needs of a small business that rents surfing related materials. The app allows for the management of an inventory and for the creation of rental instances. When a rental is finished, the app displays the total amount the client owes for the items rented. 

Notes:
 - The app assumes that items are rented and returned in the same day.
 - The app does not allow for item edits while there are active rentals. This is to prevent unexpected behaviour when modifying the underlying items of an active rental.
