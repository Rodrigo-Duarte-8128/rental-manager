# rental_manager
A kivy app that manages rentals. This was inspired by the needs of a small business that rents surfing related materials. The app allows for the management of an inventory and for the creation of rental instances, which when finished display the total amount owed for items rented.

Notes:
 - The app assumes that items are rented and returned in the same day
 - The app does not allow for items edits while there are active rentals. This is to prevent unexpected behaviour when modifying the underlying items of an active rental.
